* Install
** To install the following dependencies are needed:
+ =git= for install and updates
+ =ripgrep= required by all editors
+ =mu= for email indexing in mu4e
+ Nerd fonts including: Hack, Dejavu, Meslo, and JetBrainsMono. (not strictly needed, but will make every app basically unusable)
+ =ueberzug= for image previews in ViFM
+ =xorg-xinit= to use startx scripts
+ =arandr= to manage screen resolution
+ =exa, xdg-open, autojump, and fd= for zsh aliases
+ =blueman, redshift-gtk, network-manager-applet, trayer, xfce4-power-manager= for full xmonad

These should all be inside of standard repositories or AUR
